# plant_photo_app

A new Flutter project.


Currently the app skips actually querying device's camera to take a photo.
To do so, I'd use the image_picker package and modify the necessary podfile/xcode settings to give the project
necessary perissions to access and use the target device's camera (or simulator's gallery).
